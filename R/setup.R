#' Prepare rOpenscmRunner to run climate models.
#'
#' Some simple climate models need certain information to run. This function provides a unified
#' interface to supply this information.
#'
#' @param magiccExecutable7 The file path of a MAGICC version 7 executable file (with corresponding config file
#' structure around it). You have to supply this if you intend to run MAGICC version 7. Instead of using this
#' function to supply it, you can also set the environment variable MAGICC_EXECUTABLE_7 before starting your R session.
#' @param magiccWorkerNumber The number of processes which should be started when running MAGICC. By default, as many
#' processes are started as there are processors in your system. Instead of using this function to supply the setting,
#' you can also set the environment variable MAGICC_WORKER_NUMBER before starting your R session.
#' @param magiccWorkerRootDir The path to a folder where the temporary directories to run MAGICC will be created.
#' By default, a standard location is chosen depending on your operating system. Instead of using this function to
#' supply the setting, you can also set the environment variable MAGICC_WORKER_ROOT_DIR before starting your R session.
